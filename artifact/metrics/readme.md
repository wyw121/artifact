# Metrics Selection

We use two types of metrics to inform and complement our qualitative analysis of decompositions produced by the evaluated tools:
(a) metrics that evaluate microservice quality w.r.t. their design principles, and 
(b) metrics that compare a decomposition produced by a tool to the reference decomposition produced manually by developers.

This [folder](./scripts/) contains our scripts to calculate the metrics used in our study. Instructions on how to run the scripts can be found in the [README](./scripts/README.md) file in the same folder.
